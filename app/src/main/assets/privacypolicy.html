<p><br/></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to download and use this application.&nbsp;The purpose of this
    document is to inform how personal data collected during the use of this app is used. We reserve
    the right to alter this document at any time. The usage of this app implies consent for the
    collection of data as stated in this document</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why collect data?</strong></h3>
<p><br/> It is often very useful for developers to have access to analytics for their app. Knowing
    how users use their services, when and why is highly useful in looking critically at how their
    services may be improved. This app was built by us to serve the needs of students in regards to
    using the University Bus service, by allowing us to continually improve our services in order to
    meet the demands of our users for years to come.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Data Collected</strong></h3>
<p>The data collected during the use of this app includes</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analytics data including how the application is used and information about individual users
        including Advertising ID, events such as setting a default stop, engagement time location,
        software version, app version and other information as collected by Firebase Analytics. The
        information is anonymised and cannot be used to identify the user.
    </li>
    <li>Crash details should the application stop working for any reason. The stacktrace (a
        statement on how and why a crash happens) and non identifiable device information (such as
        software version, app version and manufacturer) as collected by Firebase Crash Reporting.
    </li>
    <li>Non identifiable device information by Google Play in line with the Google Play Store
        agreement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>None of this information will be collected by us personally, it is collected only by Firebase,
 Fabric (for use by the product Crashlytics) or Google in line with the services that we use for
    analytics and crash reporting.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How this data is used</strong></h3>
<p>The SOLE reason for collecting data in the app is to obtain insights into how the app is used as
    well as to improve services provided by the app in the future.&nbsp;This app DOES NOT
    participate in Google Adwords, Doubleclick or any other advertising service at this current
    point and it is unlikely that it will do so in the future. However should a change in this be
    made in the future, all users will be informed on this change in advance. Furthermore, the
    option of removing advertising for a one time fee will be implemented BEFORE such a change be
    made. Anonymised information collected WILL NOT be used in a manner that can be used to identify
    users.</p>
